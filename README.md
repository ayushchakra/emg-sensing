# EMG Sensing Circuit Board

Electromygraphy is a medical tool used to evaluate the health of individual muscles and
the nerve cells that dictate their movement. The intention of this project was to design a
four-channel surface electromygraphy (sEMG) printed circuit board in order to process
real-time electromyographic signals generated from a user’s muscle movements. The
board was intended to communicate with a user’s computer via Bluetooth and Serial
to provide flexibility to the physical setup, along with portability for ease of access to
EMG information. The full hardware and software overview can be found [here](https://github.com/ayushchakra/emg-sensing/blob/main/EMG_sensing_final.pdf).
