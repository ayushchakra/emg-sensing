set emg_ref to ground
vdd/2 for vref and voltage divider reference
use buffer circuit
use 10k for divider
reference opamp vdd/2
use first one for rectifier
slew rate: 1.5 mV/s for isim
mcp6021/22/24
for low pass filter, feed to negative

stuff to change (11/1/2022):
- add buffer for voltage divider to provide 1.65 v
- make more clear symbol for 1.65 v supply
- add in quad opamp chip symbol
- add bypass cap for opamp
- inamp needs bypass within 2mm and bulk within 100m
